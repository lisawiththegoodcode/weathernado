                        Check out deconstructing syntax for state being sent to components

                        getting back forecast object, separate by days

                        JS - date, get current year month day, cut that string, look at .slice, get number of the day
                        filter over the array of objects coming back, filter for ones that are todat
                        turn each day into it's own array, and then can use reduce to find lows and hieghts, chance of rain

                        might be able to find a more interesting API, something a little more useable

                        reduce, map, filter - super powerful for manipulating
